# farmapp

A mobile app that was designed primarily to centralize data entry and data viewing for the 
"Climate Change in a Hungry World" citizen science project led by Professor Aaron of Cal Poly Pomona.

This is the first version of the app, and was originally a project conceived within the HPC Support group
at Pomona ITS. So, its development was given over to another team of developers.

Most of the project was developed within a private repo, and so most of the app's git history cannot be
found in this repo. 



# Run

This app was built within the Flutter framework, so one should run it as a Flutter app. The instructions
for installing Flutter and running a Flutter app on IOS and Android are given on the official
website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
